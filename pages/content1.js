          Optical Automation, LLC, allows users to contribute different kinds of
          content, including reviews, photos, videos, events, votes, tips,
          private messages, and more. Playing nice isn’t rocket science, but
          just in case, we’ve put together these general guidelines.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Please also read the guidelines below for specific types of content
          that you might contribute to the site.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Inappropriate content: Colorful language and imagery is fine, but
          there's no need for threats, harassment, lewdness, hate speech, and
          other displays of bigotry. Conflicts of interest: Your contributions
          should be unbiased and objective. For example, you shouldn’t write
          reviews of your own business or employer, your friends’ or relatives’
          business, your peers or competitors in your industry, or businesses in
          your networking group. Promotional content: Unless you're using your
          Business Owners Account to add content to your business's profile
          page, we generally frown upon promotional content. Let's keep the site
          useful for consumers and not overrun with commercial noise from every
          user. Relevance: Please make sure your contributions are relevant and
          appropriate to the forum. For example, reviews aren't the place for
          rants about a business's employment practices, political ideologies,
          extraordinary circumstances, or other matters that don't address the
          core of the consumer experience. Privacy: Don’t publicize other
          people’s private information. Please don’t post close-up photos or
          videos of other patrons without their permission, and please don’t
          post other people’s full names unless you’re referring to service
          providers who are commonly identified by or commonly share their own
          full names. Intellectual property: Don’t swipe content from other
          sites or users. You’re a smart cookie, so write your own reviews and
          take your own photos and videos, please! Demanding payment: Beyond
          simply asking for a refund to remedy a bad experience, you should not
          use removing or posting your review as a way to extract payment from a
          business, regardless of whether you’ve been a customer.

        <br />
        <p>
          Review Guidelines The best reviews are passionate and personal. They
          offer a rich narrative, a wealth of detail, and a helpful tip or two
          for other consumers. Here are some additional thoughts for
          conscientious reviewers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Personal experience: We want to hear about your firsthand consumer
          experience, not what you heard from your co-worker or significant
          other. Try to tell your own story without resorting to broad
          generalizations and conclusory allegations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Accuracy: Make sure your review is factually correct. Feel free to air
          your opinions, but don't exaggerate or misrepresent your experience.
          We don't take sides when it comes to factual disputes, so we expect
          you to stand behind your review.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Review updates: Review updates should reflect a new experience or
          interaction with the business. Don't tell the same old story you've
          already told. If you'd like to add new insight to an old experience,
          just edit your review instead of creating a new update.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Photo and Video Guidelines Business photos and videos should be
          broadly relevant to the business and reflect the typical consumer
          experience (e.g., what the business looks like, what the business
          offers, etc.).If you post a photo or video that showcases a more
          unique personal experience with a business (e.g., your smiling group
          of friends at the bar, the fly in your soup), we may remove it from
          the photo gallery for the business, but it still may appear alongside
          your review if you write one about the business.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          User Profile Guidelines Don't be shy — use your account profile to let
          people know who you are and what makes you tick. Users want to read
          reviews from people they know and trust (not those with profiles that
          are empty or laced with inappropriate content).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Talk Guidelines Talk is a place for fun, open, and honest
          conversations about what's going on in your community. While it's easy
          to engage and post on Talk, take care with what you post since you
          can't subsequently delete it. A dash of common sense goes a long way.
          And since user trust and transparency are important to us, anonymous
          users who are disruptive to the community will probably be dealt with
          more sternly than those who stand behind their words.

          Messaging Guidelines Optical Automation, LLC has a handy messaging
          feature to keep you connected with your fellow Optical Automation, LLC
          clients. First off, please don't use this feature to harass other
          users or send other inappropriate content. Second, user accounts are
          for personal, non-commercial use only. Business owners should message
          reviewers using their free Business Owners Account. In order to do so,
          we ask that they upload a clear photo of themselves to help
          personalize their message.

        <p>
          Event Guidelines Heard about a great event in the neighborhood? Great!
          Post it to the Events tab on Optical Automation, LLC. Please don't use
          Events to post your recurring promotional announcements and sales. We
          also like to keep the content fresh, so please don't post events more
          than 6 months in advance. Business Owner Guidelines Business owners
          should be getting in on the act, too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Some words of wisdom:</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          From the Business: You can use the "From the business" tab to tell
          people a little something special about your business. Please keep it
          relevant: don't use this feature to attack your competitors,
          reviewers, or Optical Automation, LLC, and don't use it to seed
          keywords or post special offers or promotions — we'll remove them if
          we see them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Public Comments: Private messaging is often the best way to resolve a
          dispute with an unhappy customer, but business owners can also address
          issues publicly by posting a public comment. As with private
          messaging, we ask that business owners upload a clear photo of
          themselves to help personalize their message. Don't use public
          comments to launch personal attacks, advertise, or offer an incentive
          to change a review.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Video: Videos are a great way for advertisers to promote themselves on
          Optical Automation, LLC. Be as creative as you can, but please keep it
          clean. We're not big fans of imagery showing violence, drug use,
          nudity, near nudity, or suggestive acts. Content Guidelines
